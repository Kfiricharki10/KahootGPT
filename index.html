                <h3>⚠️ API Key ⚠️</h3>
                <p>KahootGPT does NOT provide an OpenAI API key. For this reason, you will need to get your own OpenAI
                    API key (OpenAI
                    provides a $5 free credit for new users, this is enough for plenty of Kahoot games!).</p>

                <h3>⚠️ OPTIONAL Paid features ⚠️</h3>
                <p>The only paid feature is Auto-tap, Auto-tap allows KahootGPT to automatically click the best fitting
                    answer according to
                    OpenAI's language models. The extension will run as normal without this purchase.</p>

                <h2>Usage</h2>
                <p>KahootGPT is designed to make playing Kahoot games easier and more enjoyable for everyone. The
                    extension can generate
                    the four best possible answers for each question, making it easier for players to choose the right
                    answer.
                    Alternatively, KahootGPT can highlight the best fitting answer, helping players focus on the most
                    accurate choice.
                    <br><br>
                    Moreover, KahootGPT can import questions from Kahoot page itself (assuming the host allows players
                    to view the questions
                    and possible answers), allowing players to use the extension with any Kahoot game. KahootGPT will
                    generate four best
                    possible answers or highlight the most correct one according to OpenAI's language model.
                    <br><br>
                    In addition to generating the best answers, KahootGPT can also auto-tap the correct answer for
                    players. This feature is
                    particularly useful for players who want to take a more passive role in the game, or for those who
                    are struggling to
                    keep up with the pace of the questions.
